    abstract = { Abstract  International scientific meetings represent important channels for communicating research results. Based on data from more than 500 proceedings of scientific meetings, organization and participation patterns of several countries (or geopolitical regions) were analyzed. Some new indicators were derived and proved to be useful in characterizing the scientific activity of the countries. Particularly, the open and closed nature of national scientific communities, as well as attraction and repulsion between certain pairs of countries could be revealed by this method. }
